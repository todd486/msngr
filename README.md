# msngr

## msngr, (pronounced 'Messenger') is an anonymous, open-source messaging service, which is free for anyone to use and communicate freely upon.

Created as a school project for my web development course, it is not intended to be a serious method of communication, rather a silly experiment to see what happens when you give people a voice free from the bounds of reality, and letting the masses decide what should stay on the front page for the day.

I hope that people can enjoy my little creation and share their thoughts on it.
